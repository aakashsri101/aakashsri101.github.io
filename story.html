    <p>Story <br> Reading | 10 mins</p>

<h6>Great you are here,</h6>

<h6>Welcome to 21st century, </h6>

<h6>A century that’s breaking records..</h6>

<p>Didn't understood, ahh, let me tell you a story,<br>
    A story of A girl</p>


<p><strong>“ Who are girls? Why are they special?"</strong><br>
    Answer to second question is they are special, this is fact
    <br>
    May be you knows, but the answer is they are too a human being created by God (if you believe in super Natural power, you too seems cool ). But the only difference is few different body parts, vocals and Hormones. 
    Few different body parts, yeah problem occurs here, these gives Girl/women power but also problem for them. 
    How ?
    </p>

<p>Here the story begins </p>
	<p>     “ A small village, a happy family of 4, A girl named Anandi, her brother, Mother and father.
        Anandi, a cute, always smiling girls studying in 11th std. Love to help her mother in household works and also sometimes her father in farming. 
        One day while she was returning from school, she was kidnapped by few mans of the same village. In the evening, when girl returns to his home, family asked her about why she is so late, then she starts crying and told whole story.”She told her family while returning from school she was kidnaped by few mens and raped her ”. Family was shocked and her brother was very angry. When father asked who were those people, she said “ Landlord’s son(Richest in the Village )”. Now her father was unable to think what to to do because police will not help them as they are more powerful and will influence Police. Then also her father went to police station to file FIR, but what happened , Police abused her father and to whole family. Her father asked all his relatives friend to help him but nobody came forward to help them. Her father can’t see a way to get justice for Anandi, so he told her to forget all this and do a fresh start. But Anandi and her brother were not ready to forget all this so easily. Anandi’s brother filed Lawsuit in District court and appointed Advocate to get justice for his sister. To collect evidences Anandi gone through series of medical test. Also, she asked her friend to testify in court but they all refused to say anything in court.
         We all know “Today money is more important then anything else“. Landlord also hired Advocate to defend his son and spend massive amt of money to win the Lawsuit. And when you spend money like water, the result will definitely be in your favour. “ Justice Sold ”. Court declared Landlords son not guilty and all allegation and document submitted by Anandi as false. 
        </p>
<p>Now Anandi and her brother were unable to see a way to seek justice. Her brother was depressed that he left village for few days. Anandi has only one thing to think about i.e. JUSTICE . </p>

<p>Suddenly she got an idea, and soon the idea worked and Landlord’s son was sentenced for 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. Whole county is now standing with Anandi and her family. Police department providing them security. </p>

<p><b>What was that idea?? Is is really happy??</b><br />
    Let me answer second question first. So Is she really happy… We don’t know, but God knows because she is with him only. She may be happy that she finally got Justice but might not be happy as the punishment to the Rapist is not comparable to the pain she beared. 
    </p>
<p>Now heading towards first question <br>
    “Todays youth are too active on social media, who thought that social media can help a girl get justice.”. When Anandi got this idea he went to all his friends who were there with him while returning home when she was kidnapped. She asked all they know about the incidence and recorded that in her phone. She made a video out of all recording and also added her medical record and sent this video to one of this male friend to add one more video and circulate this video on social media. 
    </p>
<p>“The one more video “, yeah the one in which she has done suicided. One Video call with that male friend, she asked her to record his screen, when he asked why, she said “Just do what I said”. He started recoding and then the girls confessed all what happened to him and asked to get him Justice. At that pt of time, her friend got a sense of what's going to happen but he didn't interrupted her and she has done sucide. After that, he posted video on social media and boom, people started marching for her, asking for justice and then finally she got Justice ”</p>

<p>To get Justice, a girl lost her life. </p>

<p>At the time, when we are in problem and when we desperately need our friends and family, they are not there to help you. In this situation our mind thinks about alternatives and these alternatives may be worse.</p>

<p>“We are living in a century where Law works only on paper and Justice is served to only Rich people”</p>

<p>“Sometimes an unknown may be more helpful then a known ones”</p>

<p>“We lost humanity while chasing a life that means nothing without ethics, Social values. To live happily humans should limit themselves into the boundaries of Humanity”</p>

<p>“Sucide is not an option, but sometimes it is the only option”</p>


<p>Glad you Read it.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Good Day</p>

<p>You are here means special.</p>
